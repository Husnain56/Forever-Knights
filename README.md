## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YourUser/Penance.git
cd Penance
```

---

### 2. Build Instructions

#### **Linux / macOS**

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/Penance
```

#### **Windows (with Visual Studio / MSVC)**

Open a terminal (x64 Native Tools Command Prompt or PowerShell):

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\Penance.exe
```

If you want to debug:

```powershell
cmake --build build --config Debug
.\build\Debug\Penance.exe
```

#### **Windows (with MinGW + Make)**

```sh
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build
cmake --build build
.\build\Penance.exe
```

### 3. Notes

* Always run the game from the project root (`./build/Penance`) so it can find the `resources/` folder.
* If you add new source files in `src/`, CMake will automatically pick them up.
* If you add new assets, put them in the `resources/` folder and load them in code like:

  ```cpp
  Texture2D knight = LoadTexture("resources/knight.png");
  ```

### Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++17
* **Graphics/Audio:** raylib
* **Build System:** CMake

### Team Workflow

* Clone → Create a branch → Code → Commit → Push → Open PR.
* Don’t commit anything in `build/` (already ignored).
